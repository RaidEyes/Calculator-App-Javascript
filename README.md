## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt about separating functions for their different roles instead of putting them all inside of a event. This is a good practice since it's readable and maintainable.

### Continued development

I may continue to learn vanilla javascript on future challenges since it's very hard to master.

Kevin has a good video explaining about color changing theme. I recommend you guys check him out.
